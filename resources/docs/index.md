Have scripts that automatically test and verify enviroment, and change markdown to accomodate user's OS, enviroment etc.


For example:

This example shows bash or unix shells

```sh
pip install -U pytest
```


but if user is on windows, change to powershell or cmd etc.

In other words allow users to register their environment and display resources in formats that are compatible with user's configured/registerd enviroment/OS


- Track user's progress, by checking scroll height of the users current browser window and store that infomration so that they can pick back up where they left off, of course off a refresher, that can be community built and or modified or user-defined.


 - Be able to recommend changes, for clarity sake, grammatical errors, correct spelling mistakes, and ask questions to Resource owners from users.


 It'd be nice to have a way to contribute back since the owner is displaying this information, and have a reward system for users that participate. Which should count as open source contributions, maybe request extension of resources or follow up, having Resource owners collaborate with learners!


 Create a standard interface for contributuing back to documents, to save learners cognitive load when trying to help build up the Resources they are accessing, or have a review commitee and liason that reviews incorrect submissions and offers advice and coaching, helping users contribute in a manner that is helpful for the Resource owner and project.
